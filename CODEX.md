## Project Vision

J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is **not a chatbot** —
it's a long-term AI Operating System, inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron
Man, that orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents, tools, memory and
external services through one cinematic interface.

Product shape: a **hosted web HUD** (React + TanStack Start, Supabase
backend), not a native desktop app. That single fact governs which features
below are a natural fit and which require an architectural addition (a
local bridge process) before they're possible at all — see
[Architecture constraints](#architecture-constraints).

## Principles

- **Frontend = interface. Backend = operating system.** Agents are workers,
  the Orchestrator coordinates, tools provide capabilities, memory stores
  knowledge. One clear responsibility per component.
- **Simple today, scalable tomorrow.** Small iterations, no premature
  infrastructure — but never make a decision that blocks future evolution.
  Test: *"Will this still be a good decision at 100+ agents?"*
- **Modular monolith**, not microservices, unless there's a compelling
  reason. Typical domains: Core, Agents, Tasks, Memory, Tools, Orchestrator.
- **Agents are software components, not prompts.** Identity, role, tools,
  permissions, memory, config — avoid hardcoded behavior.
- Prefer readability, explicit naming, composition over duplication. Avoid
  magic values, hidden side effects, unnecessary complexity.
- When proposing a change: explain **why**, not just what — advantages,
  disadvantages, long-term consequences. Challenge existing code if a
  clearly better solution exists; don't preserve it out of inertia.
- Business logic in the backend, presentation in the frontend — never leak
  backend details into the UI.
- **Delivery cadence: alternate Fundament and Wow.** Don't ship two
  invisible backend milestones in a row, and don't ship two demo gadgets in
  a row either. Roughly every other shipped item should be a durable
  capability (agent, tool, memory, routing — the "operating system" half)
  and the others a visible, demo-able gadget in the HUD (Vision Scanner is
  the reference example). See `TODO.md` for the current ordered queue.

## Feature Roadmap

Benchmarked 2026-07-16 against a comparable product (multi-AI Windows
desktop assistant with RAG, memory, voice, tool-calling and OS automation).
Where we already match or lead, and where their feature list points at a
real next step for **our** architecture:

### Already have (and in some cases ahead)
- AI Memory — `remember`/`recall`, pgvector semantic search (Milestone 2).
- Tool-calling agent — 11 tools, multi-step reasoning (web search, notes,
  tasks, memory, all CRUD).
- Voice — continuous conversation mode, wake-word-once + 20s follow-up
  window, echo guard (Milestone 2.2). More natural than a one-shot
  wake-word-per-utterance design.
- Web dashboard — the HUD itself; already ~30 components deep.

### Natural next steps (fit our stack directly)
1. **Multi-provider AI routing.** Today every call is hardcoded to Gemini's
   REST endpoint (`runtime.server.ts`, `tools.server.ts`). A provider
   abstraction (Claude, OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter — each just a `fetch` to a
   different endpoint with a shared function-calling contract) lets a user
   bring their own key for whichever model fits the task, or let the
   Orchestrator route by task type. Highest-value, lowest-architecture-risk
   item on this list — user's own explicit interest.
2. **RAG over personal documents.** We already proved the pattern with
   `memories` + `match_memories` (pgvector, HNSW, Gemini embeddings). Extend
   it: a `documents`/`document_chunks` schema, an upload + chunking pipeline
   (Edge Function), and a `search_documents` tool. Same infrastructure,
   new content type (PDFs, notes, project files) instead of chat-derived
   facts.
3. **Calendar / email tools.** Fits the existing tool-registry pattern
   exactly (`public.tools` + per-agent binding) — OAuth-backed integrations
   alongside `web_search`/`fetch_url`. No new architecture, just new tools.
4. **Intelligent model routing.** Falls out naturally once (1) exists — the
   Orchestrator picks a provider/model per request instead of a user
   picking one manually.

### Long-shot — needs a new architectural piece first
- **Local/desktop automation** (launch apps, organize files, browser
  automation, OS-level control) and **local AI via Ollama** both require
  code running *on the user's machine*, which a browser tab and a Supabase
  Edge Function cannot do. This is the same shape as the previously-scoped
  "Tier 3 — device bridge" (smart-home/Tapo), generalized: a small local
  companion process that authenticates to the user's account and executes
  commands queued via `device_commands`. Don't attempt either feature
  without deciding on and building that bridge first — chasing them
  directly inside the current web stack is a dead end.

## Architecture constraints

Product shape is a **hosted web app**, not an Electron/native desktop app.
Concretely, this means:
- No filesystem access, no launching local processes, no local Ollama —
  anything requiring code on the user's machine needs the bridge concept
  above, not a browser API.
- All AI calls happen server-side (Edge Function / TanStack server fn) with
  the user's own API key — never expose provider keys to the client.
- The `devices`/`device_commands` tables already exist for exactly this
  "queue a command for something outside our runtime" pattern — reuse them
  for any future local-bridge work rather than inventing a parallel channel.

## Coding & Decision-Making

- Prefer long-term maintainability > scalability > modularity, in that
  order, when solutions trade off against each other.
- Whenever proposing schema changes: explain the reasoning, the tradeoffs,
  and confirm they don't foreclose extensibility.
- Don't build long-term features prematurely — they should emerge through
  iteration, not upfront scaffolding.

# Current State (Living)

> Last audited: 2026-07-16. This section reflects the **actual live state**

> every phase or major architectural change — do not let it go stale again.

## Confirmed stack reality

- **100% TypeScript.** No Python/FastAPI code exists anywhere in this repo,
  despite earlier planning. If a Python service is introduced later, it will
  be a **separate deployment** (Render/Fly/Railway) called via `fetch` from
  a Supabase Edge Function — Edge Functions themselves run on Deno and
  cannot host Python directly. Do not assume a Python backend exists unless
  this section says otherwise.
- Orchestration lives entirely in `src/lib/agents/runtime.server.ts`
  (server-side, `chat_routing: "server"` confirmed in live `user_settings`).
  The client-side `jarvisBrain.ts` path exists but is not the active route.
- Default model: `gemini-2.5-flash` for all agents. `models.ts` is the
  single source of truth for which model IDs are offered in the UI. (Will
  need to become provider-aware once multi-provider routing lands — see
  Feature Roadmap above.)

## Two sources of truth — audit both, always

- **Git repo** = schema (SQL migrations, DDL) + all application code.
  Reliable for structure, never reliable for row-level data.
- **Live Supabase data** (agent rows, tool bindings, settings) can be
  created directly by the running app (e.g. via an "add agent" UI action)
  **without ever producing a migration file**. The `marketer` agent was
  discovered this way — it was invisible from git alone.
- Practical rule: before any planning session that touches agents/tools,
  pull a fresh data snapshot (agents, tools, agent_tools, user_settings —
  excluding `user_secrets` and conversational tables) rather than relying on
  migrations or memory of past sessions.
- **The drift runs the other way too, and it's the one that actually bit
  us:** a migration file merged into git is **not** applied to the live
  database automatically. This project applies SQL migrations manually —
  the user pastes the migration's SQL into the Supabase SQL editor
  themselves; nothing in the GitHub → Lovable pipeline runs it on merge.
  Confirmed 2026-07-16: `20260716150000_guardian_agent.sql` merged
  cleanly, but the `guardian` agent didn't exist live, the chat agent
  selector and Agent Hub didn't show it, and the Orchestrator's live
  roster genuinely didn't include it (so it couldn't delegate, and
  improvised opening System Logs instead when asked to consult it).
  **Whenever a migration is added, paste its full SQL directly into the
  chat reply** (not just "I added a migration file") so the user can copy
  it straight into Supabase — don't assume merging the PR was the last
  step.

## Agent registry (live, as of 2026-07-16)

| slug | status | model | tools bound | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `orchestrator` | enabled | gemini-2.5-flash | 11 tools (web_search, fetch_url, save_note, list_notes, delete_note, remember, recall, create_task, list_tasks, update_task, delete_task) | Default agent, auto-seeded per user via `handle_new_user()`. `config.system_prompt` empty — uses code-level `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` as-is. |
| `marketer` | enabled | gemini-2.5-flash | web_search | Created via app UI (not a migration). Fixed 2026-07-10: `config.system_prompt` now contains **only** the Marketer specialization, no identity/language text — that comes exclusively from `persona.ts`. This is the pattern to follow for every future agent. |
| `guardian` (Strażnik) | enabled | gemini-2.5-flash | 3 tools (guardian_scan_errors, guardian_run_stats, guardian_check_delegation) | Added 2026-07-16 via migration (`20260716150000_guardian_agent.sql`) for every existing + future user — the "seed through a migration, not the UI" lesson from `marketer` applied. Read-only system-health monitoring + active smoke-tests over `event_log`/`agent_runs`. Explicitly **no** code/filesystem access and **no** UI/voice test automation — see TODO.md for why that's out of scope for any in-app agent. |

`delegate_to_agent` tool-calling exists in `runtime.server.ts` and was
**verified end-to-end 2026-07-10** (orchestrator run `eb968ad8` →
`delegate_to_agent(slug: "marketer", ...)` → marketer run `115fb1fc`
executed ~2s later, output relayed back). `agent_runs.parent_run_id` was
fixed 2026-07-13 (commit `c40347a`) — this section had gone stale claiming
it as an open gap for three days past that fix; caught 2026-07-16 while
scoping the Guardian agent. `guardian_check_delegation` now exists
specifically so this kind of regression gets caught by a smoke-test
instead of by a documentation audit next time.

## Known dead/inconsistent config

- `user_settings.default_model` (currently `gemini-2.5-flash`) is **not
  actually read by anything** — each agent's own `agents.model` column
  wins. Either wire it up as a real fallback when `agents.model` is null,
  or remove it to avoid confusion.
- Commit history on the connected branch is mostly generic ("Changes") from
  Lovable auto-sync. Not urgent, but write clearer commit messages going
  forward for anything done directly in github.dev.

## Milestone log

- **Milestone 1 (2026-07-14)** — Orchestrator gained Memory
  (`remember`/`recall` on `public.memories`) and Tasks
  (`create_task`/`list_tasks`/`update_task` on new `public.tasks`).
  Migration `20260714101500_memory_and_tasks_tools.sql`.
- **Milestone 2 (2026-07-15)** — Tasks UI (dashboard widget + `/tasks`
  page), semantic recall (pgvector + `match_memories` RPC, Gemini
  `gemini-embedding-001` embeddings merged with ILIKE), `created_by_agent`/
  `memories.agent_id` attribution. Migration
  `20260715093000_semantic_memory.sql`.
- **Milestone 2.1 (2026-07-15)** — Bug fixes from live testing: system
  prompt now always carries the real current date/time (agents previously
  guessed relative dates from training data); CRUD parity — added
  `list_notes`, `delete_note`, `delete_task` tools. Migration
  `20260715120000_note_task_delete_tools.sql`.
- **Milestone 2.2 (2026-07-15)** — Voice conversation mode: wake word
  required only to start, 20s follow-up window after each reply (extended
  per utterance), echo guard against JARVIS hearing his own TTS,
  `wake_word_enabled` setting finally wired up (was dead since initial
  schema). All in `VoiceCommandContext.tsx`, no backend changes.
- **Milestone 3 (2026-07-16)** — Dashboard depth pass (PRs #10-#12).
  `HudPanel` gained an `"elevated" | "quiet"` tone; the real fix, found via
  live DOM inspection rather than screenshots, was a cascade-layer bug in
  `styles.css`: an unlayered `.hud-panel > * { position: relative }` rule
  was silently beating Tailwind's layered `.absolute` utility on every
  panel in the app (unlayered CSS always wins regardless of specificity),
  forcing decorative absolutely-positioned elements into normal flow. Fixed
  by moving it into `@layer utilities` + `:where()`. Hero panel dropped
  552px → 264px. Hero redesign reuses `ArcReactorTriangle` (previously
  sidebar-only) + a new shared `useAgentStatus()` hook instead of a second
  bespoke decoration.
- **Milestone 4 (2026-07-16)** — Guardian (Strażnik) agent, see Phase 3
  below.

Beyond the Marketer prompt-only agent, the HUD already has ~30 components
including boot sequence, voice, threat stream, system logs, sub-systems,
and a **`geo-tracking` route** (Leaflet-based, Warsaw fallback) that predates
formal documentation of it here. Treat the frontend as further along than
the backend/agent layer — new agent work should assume a fairly complete
HUD shell already exists to plug into.

### Arc Core reactor components (consolidated 2026-07-14)

The reactor visuals were consolidated during a Lovable-driven Arc Core /
scaling pass. The legacy `ReactorCore.tsx` (~400 lines) and `ArcCoreWidget.tsx`
were **removed**; there is now a single pair of SVG components, both driven
purely by `--primary` and CSS animations (no runtime state, safe to render
anywhere):

- `MiniArcReactor.tsx` — small spinning three-triangle mark, `size` prop
  (default 28). Used in the sidebar header, boot/login, and module frames.
- `ArcReactorTriangle.tsx` — the large radial reactor. Self-scales
  responsively via Tailwind (`w-[min(48vmin,360px)]`, `max-md:`,
  `landscape:max-md:`, `short:`) and accepts `raised` + `className` for
  per-slot overrides.

In the sidebar, `ArcCorePanel` (in `AppSidebar.tsx`) wraps
`ArcReactorTriangle` with size overrides (`!w-[160px]`, `short:!w-[100px]`,
mobile `!w-[100px]`/`short:!w-[80px]`) — this is the "Zmniejszono Arc Core
w sidebarze" change. No orphaned references to the removed components
remain.

Since Milestone 3, `ArcReactorTriangle` is also used in the dashboard
hero (`routes/index.tsx`, `!w-[150px]`), both consumers reading live
status (Speaking / Processing / Listening / Standby) from a shared
`useAgentStatus()` hook (`components/jarvis/useAgentStatus.ts`) wrapping
`speak.ts` + `agentActivity.ts` — don't duplicate that logic again if a
third consumer shows up, extend the hook instead.

## Phase status vs. original 3-phase plan

- **Phase 1 (Marketer):** agent exists, persona bug fixed, tool binding
  fixed, delegation verified end-to-end (2026-07-10).
- **Phase 2 (Analityk / file analysis):** not started, and **reordered
  after Strażnik** (see below) — decided 2026-07-16. Still the right
  eventual scope: file-parsing tools in TypeScript (`xlsx`/SheetJS,
  `papaparse`) inside the existing Edge Function runtime, no Python service
  unless a specific capability genuinely requires it. Overlaps with the
  "RAG over personal documents" Feature Roadmap item — merge into one piece
  of work rather than building twice, whenever it's picked back up.
- **Phase 3 (Strażnik logów / Guardian): done, 2026-07-16.** Reordered
  ahead of Phase 2 because it reuses existing `event_log`/`agent_runs`
  data (no new pipeline). Shipped as `guardian_scan_errors` (recent
  errors/warnings), `guardian_run_stats` (per-agent trend/regression
  detection), `guardian_check_delegation` (smoke-tests the `parent_run_id`
  fix stays fixed). Migration `20260716150000_guardian_agent.sql`.
  Deliberately scoped to read-only backend/data monitoring — no code/
  filesystem access, no UI/voice test automation (see `TODO.md` for why
  that's out of scope for any in-app agent, not just this one).

Two new agent ideas beyond the original 3-phase plan, tentatively queued
in `TODO.md`:
- **Concierge** (calendar/email) — cheap, prompt-only like Marketer, paired
  with the calendar/email OAuth tools item.
- Second wow-gadget slot may eventually want a **Researcher**-style agent
  (deep multi-step web research, complementing Marketer's marketing focus)
  once RAG-on-documents exists to ground it — not scheduled yet, noted for
  when that decision comes up.

## Immediate next steps

Superseded by **`TODO.md`** at the repo root — that file is now the single
ordered, checkable execution queue (Fundament/Wow/UI tagged, per the
cadence principle above). Keep this section as architecture context only;
update `TODO.md` as items ship instead of duplicating a list here.

### 2026-07-16 frontend note

The last Lovable-driven visual pass (`.lovable/plan.md`, "Premium AI OS
Visual Refresh — v2") was scoped as *styling-only*: rounded corners, soft
glow, a decorative background layer — it explicitly kept every panel's
existing box composition untouched ("Zero moved/renamed/removed
features"). That is why it read as "just rounded corners" rather than the
deeper dark/glass redesign that was actually wanted — the plan never
touched panel composition, only its edges.

Decided direction (after reviewing a live screenshot against
`src/routes/index.tsx`, which wraps every section in one uniform
`space-y-6` stack of equal-weight `HudPanel`s): keep the single-column
layout, but give panels real elevation/layering and let selected elements
bleed past their container edge, instead of every section being a flat,
equally-weighted, strictly-clipped box. **Shipped — see Milestone 3
above.**
